Python - Async Comprehension

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

How to write an asynchronous generator
How to use async comprehensions
How to type-annotate generators
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
Tasks
0. Async Generator
mandatory
Write a coroutine called async_generator that takes no arguments.

The coroutine will loop 10 times, each time asynchronously wait 1 second, then yield a random number between 0 and 10. Use the random module.
Repo:

GitHub repository: holbertonschool-web_back_end
Directory: python_async_comprehension
File: 0-async_generator.py



1. Async Comprehensions
mandatory
Import async_generator from the previous task and then write a coroutine called async_comprehension that takes no arguments.

The coroutine will collect 10 random numbers using an async comprehensing over async_generator, then return the 10 random numbers.
Repo:

GitHub repository: holbertonschool-web_back_end
Directory: python_async_comprehension
File: 1-async_comprehension.py


2. Run time for four parallel comprehensions
mandatory
Import async_comprehension from the previous file and write a measure_runtime coroutine that will execute async_comprehension four times in parallel using asyncio.gather.

measure_runtime should measure the total runtime and return it.

Notice that the total runtime is roughly 10 seconds, explain it to yourself.
